## Description

A website showcasing my work to potential employers. The site features stylized links to projects deployed on github which showcase my abilities as a developer; as well as a responsive mobile first design.

## Conclusion
Through this project I was able to build a webpage from scratch and explore a variety of css styling methods to achieve the desired design. Most notably I learned alot about leveraging psuedo-elements to achieve desired design effects.
