                    It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

                    Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Be quiet! I am your king. Did you dress her up like this? The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.
